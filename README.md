Problem Statement

The bank provides financial services/products such as savings accounts, current accounts and debit cards to its customers. In order to increase its overall revenue, the bank conducts various marketing campaigns for its financial products, for example, credit cards, term deposits and loans. These campaigns are geared towards the bankâ€™s existing customers. However, the marketing campaigns need to be cost-efficient so that the bank's overall revenues as well as total profit increase. You need to apply your knowledge of EDA on the given data set to analyse the patterns and provide inferences/solutions for future marketing campaigns.
